2. Local preview (simple)
   - Open `index.html` in your browser, OR
   - Serve the folder with a simple HTTP server:
     - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`  then open http://localhost:8000
     - Node: `npx http-server` (if installed)

3. Deploy
   - Push to your hosting provider (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify or upload to your VPS).

CUSTOMIZATION GUIDE
-------------------
1. Branding
   - Replace logo files in `/assets/img/` and update references in `index.html`.
   - Update site title, meta description, and keywords in `<head>`.

2. Colors & Typography
   - Modify CSS in `/assets/css/` (or edit SCSS if using a preprocessor).
   - For quick changes, add a small custom css file (e.g., `assets/css/custom.css`)
     and include it after the template css.

3. Navigation / Pages
   - Update the nav links in `index.html` and add new pages to `/pages/`.
   - Keep consistent hero, sections, and footer structure provided by Dewi.

4. Icons (Bootstrap Icons)
   - Edit icon classes in HTML (e.g., `<i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i>`).
   - To change the color of an icon, add utility classes or inline CSS:
     - Example: `<i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill text-success me-2"></i>`
     - Or: `<i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill" style="color:#ba543a"></i>`

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- Layout looks bad after edits: check for missing CSS or JS includes and ensure
  the order of stylesheet/script tags is preserved.
- Icons not showing: ensure Bootstrap Icons are loaded and classes are correct.
- Images not showing: check file paths and correct folder placement.

CHANGELOG
---------
- v1.0 — Initial setup based on Dewi template; added FSC — Philippines content.

===============================================================================
Thank you for using the Dewi template as the base for CodM Software.
If you want, I can also:
 - produce a ready-to-paste HTML snippet for the FSC section,
 - provide a 2–3 line hero/card version in HTML,
 - or generate a Markdown `README.md` version.
